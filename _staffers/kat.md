Salutations! My name is Kathleen, and I graduated from Berkeley this past year with a double major in Computer Science and Linguistics. I took CS10 my first semester here, and I’ve been involved on course staff since. After the summer, I will be moving to New York to work as a software engineer at a startup called Bubble. Please stop by my office hours if you’d like to chat; I look forward to meeting you all!
