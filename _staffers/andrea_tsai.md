Heya! I'm Andrea (she/her), a sophomore studying Cognitive Science and Data Science.
Despite taking CS10 during the COVID pandemic, the community was really warm, encouraging, and supportive. I hope to continue fostering that atmosphere, and you are always welcome to talk or ask me any questions :)
In my free time, I like to read, embroider, and explore new things.
