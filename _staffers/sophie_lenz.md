Hi! My name is Sophie and I'm a third year studying CogSci and Data Science. This is my third time as a CS10 AI, and I'm so excited to be helping out again this semester. I really enjoyed my time in CS10, and I'm looking forward to giving the same experience to all of the students! Outside of class, you can catch me drinking boba, watching sports, or going on walks. Hope to see you all in lab! :)
