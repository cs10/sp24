Yo! My name is Marius and I’m a junior majoring in Applied Math and Computer Science. I took CS10 Spring 2022 and have been involved with the course on staff ever since. I’m pumped to see what this summer has for all of us! I came into Berkeley with no coding experience and I remember how my roommates (who were in 61A/B at the time) screens used to look like giberish while they did hw. I had no idea what CS was so I decided just to try it out by taking CS10. The class quickly became my favorite I’ve taken so far at Berkeley as it opened up the world of programming to me in a very beginner-friendly way. I hope to lend other students a hand in finding their way into Computer Science as a whole and maybe even find a passion like I did :)
