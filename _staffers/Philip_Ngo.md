Hi!! I am a freshman from Long Beach, CA (562 rep!) studying Data Science and Linguistics. I came to Berkeley with no coding experience and took CS10 my first semester and loved it. Some of my hobbies/interests are music (frequent UCBSO enjoyer), scrolling on Twitter, and an avid board game enthusiast. I hope you enjoy this class and I look forward to meeting you all! :D
