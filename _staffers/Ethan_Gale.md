Hi! My name is Ethan, and I am a first year EECS major from Los Angeles. Taking CS-10 during my first semester at Berkeley was one of the best decisons I ever made. It truly opened my eyes to the Beauty and Joy of Computing! I am excited to to meet you all! Feel free to reach out to me for anything. Cheers!
