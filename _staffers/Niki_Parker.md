Hi! I'm Niki, a sophomore studying CS and Cogsci. My interests are in Data, Software, Neuroscience, and the intersection: whether that be medtech, AI, or teaching! I loved CS10 so much and I am so excited to come back. There is so much to love about this course, and I can't wait to be part of your journey!
