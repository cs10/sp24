Hey everyone! Iâ€™m a senior studying Computer Science + Data Science, and this is my 6th semester working on staff for CS10. I took CS10 during my spring semester of Freshman year and I love the creative and critical thinking aspects that CS provides, so I decided to change my major to CS! My lab slides can be found <a href="https://portfolio-mehul-gandhi.vercel.app/notes">here</a>. This semester, I'm learning fullstack development through personal projects! During my free time, I like to watch anime, try out new restaurants, and host social events for clubs! I'm super excited to work with all of you this semester :)
