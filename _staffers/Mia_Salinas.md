Hello! :) My name is Mia. Iâ€™m a freshman studying Media Studies and CS and this is my first time teaching CS-10. This class was my first CS taken at Berkeley and I loved it! I hope everyone also gets to love this course as much as I do and I'm here to help with anything! Don't hesitate to reach out!
