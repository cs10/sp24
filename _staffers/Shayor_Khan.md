Hello friends. I'm a freshman currently majoring in Economics and intending to major in Computer Science as well. In my free time I like to eat out at different places with friends so feel free to ask for food recommedations. I did CS10 last semester and it was the most fun I ever had with a class, so I'm ecstatic to have this opportunity to accompany you all in your CS10 jounreys :>
