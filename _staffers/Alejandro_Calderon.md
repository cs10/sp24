Hey there! I am a sophomore intending to major in Computer Science. I am from Los Angeles and came to UC Berkeley with zero coding experience. CS10 was my introduction to coding, and I had a great time taking the class and would like for incoming students to have the same experience. I hope to be helpful, and am looking forward to working with you all!
