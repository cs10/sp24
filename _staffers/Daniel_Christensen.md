Hi! Iâ€™m a sophmore studying Chemistry and intending to also declare data science. This is my first time teaching in CS-10. As someone who started out with zero programming experience, I understand gaining a footing in computer science can be difficult. My primary goal this semester is to guide other students in their introduction to computer science while also pushing them to achieve their goals! You're capable of more than you know. :)
