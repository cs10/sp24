Hey there! Iâ€™m a rising junior majoring in CS and Cognitive Science. After taking CS10 in Spring 2020, I AI-ed for CS10 for three semesters, and this is my first time being a reader. Outside of school, I enjoy reading, traveling, doing photography, and playing sports. Looking forward to meeting you this summer!
