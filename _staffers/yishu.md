Hello hello, Iâ€™m a senior double majoring in CS and CogSci. I have been involved with CS10 as an AI, reader, and TA since Spring 2020 when I first took the class. CS10 was the first programming class I have ever taken, and I loved it so much that I decided to major in CS. I hope you will come to love this class as much as I did, and I cannot wait for an exciting semester ahead!
