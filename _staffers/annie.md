Hi! My name is Annie, and I am a 3rd year student studying environmental sciences and data science. I took CS10 my second semester at Cal and have been an AI ever since. I am super excited to be on staff for CS10 and hope you love it as much as I do! I enjoy reading mystery novels, baking, and taking long walks.
