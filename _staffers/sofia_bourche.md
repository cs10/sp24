Hey everyone! Iâ€™m a senior studying Computer Science from San Diego, CA. I've been an AI for CS10 for 5 semesters and have served as a Tutor as well. I discovered my love for programming as a student in CS10, and I hope you will too! In my free time, I enjoy dance, baking, surfing, traveling and teaching!
