Hey everyone! Iâ€™m a senior studying Computer Science from San Diego, CA. This will be my 6th semester as an AI for CS10 and I was a Tutor this summer as well. I discovered my love for programming as a student in this class, and I hope that you will too! In my free time, I enjoy dancing on The Cal Dance Team, baking, surfing, traveling and teaching!
