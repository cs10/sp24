Hey everyone! I'm a first-year student studying CS with a minor in Data Science. CS10 has been such an amazing class coming into Berkeley for the very first time. My goal for this semester is to help those students who may not necessarily fully comprehend problems and push them to discover a passion for problem-solving and programming with Snap! and Python.
