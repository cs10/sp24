Hi! I’m a second year studying Math and I’ve been a part of CS10 for 4 semesters now. I took CS10 in my first semester at Cal and I loved the material and environment so much that I decided to join course staff the semester after. In my free time, I enjoy going to Berkeley’s book stores, exploring campus, playing the violin, and doing jigsaw puzzles. Looking forward to a great summer class!
