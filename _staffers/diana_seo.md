Hi! I'm a recent graduate who graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in CS(go bears!). This will be my fourth time AIing for CS10 :) I started college with no CS experience, but CS10 motivated me to pursue CS as a major. I hope you enjoy CS10 as much as I did, and I will try my best to be the best motivator. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, concerns, or if you want to chat with me in general!
