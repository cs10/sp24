Hi everyone! I'm Nahee, a freshman intending to study CS. I'm super excited to be an AI for CS10 - a course that turned my life around! BJC opened up an exciting world of computing for me, sparking my first true passion. I hope this course will inspire you as much as it did me. Looking forward to meeting you all!
