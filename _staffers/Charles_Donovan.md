Hello there! I am a rising sophomore studying CS. I'm originally from Thailand and I'm so excited to support you all during this fall. CS10 was my start to programming and it was such a fun time. I hope with our support, you'll not only thrive but foster a deep appreciation for coding! :) Aside from CS, I enjoy being a photographer for FAST @ Berkeley & teaching the Digital Painting DeCal.
