Hi everyone! I am a junior studying EECS, and this is my first time being an AI for CS10. When I came to Berkeley, I had no prior CS experience, and I was ready to give up on it... until I took CS10. I strongly believe CS10 will help you all as much as it helped me and I am excited to be a part of that!
