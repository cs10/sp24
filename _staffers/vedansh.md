Hey there! I'm a rising senior studying Computer Science, Cognitive Science, and Data Science. This is my seventh term teaching at Cal (I've taught in EECS & Cognitive Science), and I've been a Discussion-AI / TA / Head-TA / Summer-Instructor for CS10.\
\
This Fall, I'll serve as an U/G advisory-board member for Berkeley's (brand-new) [College of Computing, Data Science, and Society](https://data.berkeley.edu/), continue [developing curriculum](https://data.berkeley.edu/hce-team) for upper-division Data-Science courses and continue working on an exciting [Natural Language Processing](https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing) / [Machine Learning](https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning) research project. If any of that sounds interesting, I'm happy to chat about it in Office Hours!\
\
My primary goal this term is to help students discover and come to appreciate the remarkable beauty of problem-solving, for which, Computer-Science is an indispensable tool!\
