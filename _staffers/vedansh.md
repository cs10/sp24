**Office Hours: Tr 1700-1750hrs in SDH-200**

Hey there! I'm a senior studying Computer Science, Cognitive Science, and Data Science. This is my eighth term teaching at Cal (I've taught in EECS & Cognitive Science), and I've been a Discussion-AI / TA / Head-TA / Summer-Instructor for CS10.\
\
This Spring, I'll serve as an U/G advisory-board member for Berkeley's [College of Computing, Data Science, and Society](https://data.berkeley.edu/) and on the innaugural [Police Accountability Board](https://chancellor.berkeley.edu/uc-berkeley-police-accountability-board-roster), continue [developing curriculum](https://data.berkeley.edu/hce-team) for upper-division Data-Science courses, and try to learn Chinese ([你好!](https://dictionary.hantrainerpro.com/chinese-english/translation-nihao_hello.htm)) If any of that sounds interesting, I'm happy to chat about it in Office Hours!\
\
My primary goal this term is to help you discover and come to appreciate the remarkable beauty of problem-solving, for which, Computer-Science is an indispensable tool!\
