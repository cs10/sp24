Hi! I’m Maddie L, a fourth-year Compsci major. I took CS10 my freshman year and fell even deeper in love with CS. I’m a Bay Area native and come home (an hour from Berkeley) frequently to hang out with family. When I’m not coding, you can find me watching Hank Green’s Journey to the Microcosmos (would highly recommend), forcing my boyfriend who has perfect pitch to transcribe that one melody from that one song, or attempting to play Roblox with my nine year old sister (nothing makes me feel more ancient). I’m so pumped to be TAing this summer and am looking forward to getting to know you all!
