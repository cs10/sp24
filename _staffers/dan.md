I'm just so delighted to be teaching the course again! I co-invented BJC in 2008 with my good friend and colleague Brian Harvey, and absolutely love teaching it. I'm passionate about bringing engaging and powerful CS "big ideas" to students who normally wouldn't be exposed to it. I am humbled by all the national attention BJC has received (see the "in the News" part of my website) and hope you find this class beautiful and joyful! When I'm not working, you can find me traveling, playing golf or board games (e.g., Monopoly Deal), or binging shows (anything Pixar or Marvel) with my family. p.s. My wife and I both went to Cal for grad school... Go Bears!
