Hi!!! I'm a rising senior studying CogSci and this is my second time AI-ing for CS-10. I came to Berkeley with minimal background in programming and CS10 was a great intro to understanding coding conceptually while still being fun and engaging. I hope I can facilitate that same understanding as your AI this semester and I'm excited to meet everyone in the upcoming weeks :]
