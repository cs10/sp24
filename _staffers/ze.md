Hellooo I'm Ze, and I'm a rising junior majoring in CS! I took CS10 my freshman year and have been AI-ing since then, and I am insanely excited and nervous to be working with you all this summer :smile:.  In my free time I like petting my cat Pixel (who you will ALL see a picture of), drawing, listening to music, and walking around random places. Oh I also really like mechanical keyboards and dinosaurs (I hope you can tell from my profile picture). I look forward to getting to know all of you; this summer will be PAW-some!
