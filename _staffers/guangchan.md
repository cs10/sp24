Hello! My name is Tom Shang, and Iâ€™m a rising junior studying Computer Science. After taking this class my first semester here, I not only discovered my passion for CS, but also made tons of valuable memories and met one my best friends. In my freetime, I enjoy playing basketball, jamming on my guitar, and goofing off with the boys. I hope you will all love CS 10 as much as I do!
