Wassup fellas :smile:. I'm a random CS major from New Zealand who has been a part of the CS10 family since Fall 2018 (when I took the course). I'm just here because CS10 has quite literally changed my life because I loved it so much, but a tiny bonus is that I love teaching and making sure you all get the most out of CS10. Lookin' forward to getting to know ya'll!
