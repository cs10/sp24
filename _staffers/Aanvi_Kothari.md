Namaste! I’m Aanvi, from Calcutta, India. I’m a sophomore studying CS and minoring in Electronic Systems. I took CS10 last fall and enjoyed it thoroughly- it’s still my favourite class so far. I’m super excited to get to know everyone as a tutor this sem. In my free time, catch me swimming or reading. Don’t hesitate to shoot me an email or meet up for any questions you may have!
