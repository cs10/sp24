Hello! My name is Jimmy, and  Iâ€™m a senior studying math. I took CS10 last Spring, and this is my second time being an AI . I have to say BJC is the class I enjoyed the most at Cal.  In my free time, I am always trying to explore restaurants in the city (I am a big foodie). Feel free to reach me out for food spots or anything else!
