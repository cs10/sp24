Hello! Iâ€™m a rising junior studying Data Science and Applied Math, and this is my first time as an Academic Intern for CS10. Berkeley's CS classes can be quite challenging for the students who do have prior experience and especially for those that are just now exploring the field. I hope to help students ease their way into computer science as seamlessly as possible, and help them love this unique and versatile subject!
