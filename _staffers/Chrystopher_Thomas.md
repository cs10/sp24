Hello everyone! This is my first year here at Cal after transferring. I'm currently pursuing cognitive science and computer science. This is my first time AI-ing, but I'd love to help everyone do their very best! In my free time, I love playing video games (currently obsessed with Poppy Playtime and FNAF Security Breach), and playing with my cat Billie-Jean. I hope you all have a wonderful time in CS10; it's a great class!
