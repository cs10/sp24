Hey !! My name is Calvin Duong (he/him) and I’m a junior studying CS. I took CS10 my freshmen year and it was definitely one of my favorite classes. I didn’t have much programming experience coming into Berkeley so CS10 really paved the way for my CS journey. Looking forward to working with everyone this semester and feel free to message me via email if you have any questions
