Hi hi! I'm Kellyann (she/they), a senior studying CS and theater management! Like most of the staff, I had never programmed before college and took CS10 before I joined staff. Outside of school, I do research in the Berkeley Center for New Media into TV representation and try to meet my reading goals on Goodreads (I am at a solid 1/5 books for 2021 right now). Though I won't be teaching a section this summer, come drop by my office hours if you're looking for assignment help or advice or just want somewhere to vent for a hot sec!
