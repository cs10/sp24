Hello! I am a second semester freshman! I took CS10 in Fall 2023, and this is my first time as an AI! Coming in with minimal knowledge only gained from APCSP, CS10 was able to support me to go on with the CS series! I am an intended CS Major with a potential double in Data Science, emphasis in biology. I hope to help in any way I can and we can learn together. ૮ ˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶ ა
