Hi everyone! My name is Miranda Zhu (she/her). Iâ€™m a sophomore intending to study CS and Data Science, and this is my first time being an AI! I am really excited to meet you and hope we can learn and grow together this semester. CS 10 was my first programming class at Cal; it will be a great start for those who haven't programmed before. In my free time, I like dancing, singing, and watching K-dramas. Feel free to contact me anytime!
