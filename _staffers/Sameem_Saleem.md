'Sup! You can call me Sam! I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science from Hayward, CA. I hope I can ignite or grow your interest in CS! I have work on numerous projects, so send me an email if you have an idea you want to build. I've always been passionate about education and games - as well as mixing both; for many years I've worked on making CS learning fun and engaging! Aside from CS10, I'm president of the Google Developer Student Club where I lecture and teach workshops, so if you want more, I'll see you there! Some things I love include engineering, creating, socializing, designing, and drawing. (I'm on the right in the picture)
