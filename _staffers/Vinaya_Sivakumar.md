Hi! :) Iâ€™m a freshman studying computer science and cognitive science, and this is my first time teaching CS-10. As someone who didn't have too much programming experience before this class, I experienced the CS learning curve at Berkeley firsthand. That's why I'm back as course staff this semester to help you, as corny as it sounds, experience the beauty and joy of computing.
