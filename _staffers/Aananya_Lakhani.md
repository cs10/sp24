Hi! :) Iâ€™m a sophmore studying mechanical engineering, I have been an AI for 2 semesters and this is my first time being a tutor for CS10. I came into CS10 fall of 2022 without a lot of coding experience, however, with the support of the CS10 staff I was able to learn so much in just one semester. I love the CS10 community and I hope to provide that same support to students this semester!
