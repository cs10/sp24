Hello everyone! I am currently a sophomore, majoring in EECS, and this is my first time becoming an AI for CS-10. My first time studying CS was filled with trials and tribulations, and I know how easy it is to get discouraged. Even I had my moments, but the people around me supported me and uplifted me, allowing me to prosper in the field that continues to challenge me even today. I want to pay it forward by welcoming new-comers with open arms to let them know that there is always support for them here in Berkeley to make them successful.
