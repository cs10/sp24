 Hi! I'm a rising senior studying Data Science and Cognitive Science, and this is my first time on staff for CS-10! I came to Berkeley with zero programming experience and experienced first-hand how difficult CS courses can be as a beginner. Thus, I would love to provide students with a motivating and encouraging learning space. I like watching/playing sports and grinding some Rocket League when I have free time. Feel free to reach out to me about anything. I look forward to working with you. :)
