Hey! I'm Helina, a sophomore studying CS and English. Like many people, I took CS 10 when I had very little experience with programming, and I loved it! It gave me the confidence and passion to continue with the CS major, so I want to support new students in pursuing their own goals in the same way. Excited to work with y'all!
