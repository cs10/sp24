Hi everyone! I'm a 4th year majoring in Data Science. I had no programming experience when I took CS10 back in Spring 2021. To this day, this class has been one of my most enjoyable and rewarding classes as it made me want to explore more computer science and data science courses. I have been an AI ever since I took the class and now I'm excited to be a tutor! Aside from school, I love listening to music, watching horror movies, and going on walks in nature. I wish you all a great semester :)
