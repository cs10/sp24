Hi, I'm Amy (she/her)! I'm a senior majoring in Data Science. I had little to no CS experience prior to CS10. This class became one of my favorite classes that I've taken here at Berkeley. I've been an AI for 4 semesters and a Tutor for 2 semesters now! On my free time I love watching horror movies, listening to music, or taking nature walks. I'm super excited to help you all out this semester!
