Hello! I’m Raka, a junior majoring in CS. I have been an AI and a reader before, and this is my second time being a UCS-1 for CS 10. Before coming into Berkeley, I had never coded before, but taking CS 10 opened my eyes to the wonderful world of Computer Science and really helped me for my future classes. I hope all of you can enjoy CS 10 as much as I did!
