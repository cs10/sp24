Hi! I am a sophomore intending to major in Physics and minor in EECS, and this is my first-time tutoring CS 10. I took the course Fall 2022, inspiring me to pursue EECS as my minor. I joined the class with ZERO experience in coding, and I left the class with rich skills to start my CS journey here at Cal. I hope to support you throughout the course!
