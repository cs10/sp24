Hey! :) Here is Sarah and I’m currently a freshman who really interested in CS, Stat, and Desgin. This is my first time join the CS10 teaching team. Having experienced Dan's teaching style, I've grown to deeply appreciate the CS10 community—I genuinely hope you will too! I frequently participate in hackathons in my spare time, which not only hones my skills but also ignites my interest in various fields like edtech, arvrxr, and aiml. Through CS10, I look forward to exploring the endless possibilities of computer science with you. Let's grow together in this brilliant class, discovering the joy and beauty of problem-solving along the way!
