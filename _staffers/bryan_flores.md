Hey! My name is Bryan and Iâ€™m a junior studying Data Science. As someone who started out with no programming experience before college, I felt that CS10 was perfect introduction for me back when I took it my freshmen year. When I'm not working on HW/Projects, I will probably be watching Netflix or playing video games. I hope you enjoy CS10 and am looking forward to helping as an AI!
