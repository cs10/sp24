Hi CS 10ersQ!!!
Sanjida here! I'm a sophomore studying EECS and I feel so happy to be a part of CS-10 once again.
When I took CS-10 first, I came in with very little CS experience. As an EECS major, I have to stick to CS for the rest of my journey at Cal, so, I thought a gentle and thorough intro would be the best for me and I was lucky to find that in this awesome class. I hope to work together with the enthusiastic programmers of this semester and try my best to support you throughout the journey. I wish this BJC journey brings out a more confident programmer out of you!
