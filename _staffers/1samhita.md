Hello hello:) I’m Samhita, a senior majoring in media studies and sociology, with a minor in education! I took CS10 my first semester at Cal and have been part of the family ever since! Outside of school, I’m working at an internship in healthcare communications, managing production at the Daily Cal, eating great Thai food in Berkeley, taking lots of naps, rewatching White Collar for the 10th time, and, most importantly, leading the amazing Reader team for CS10 this summer! So excited to meet y’all!
