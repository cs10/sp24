Hi everyone! My name is Vincent and I'm a third-year studying Data Science and Computer Science. To this day, CS10 is still my favorite class at Berkeley, and I'm super excited to be AIing for the first time. I'm looking forward to meeting you all in lab, and I hope to make CS10 a smooth and enjoyable experience! :)
