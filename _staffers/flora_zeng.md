Hi! I’m Flora and I’m a senior studying Computer Science. I’m always down for outdoor activities whether it’s running, hiking, climbing, dancing, or skateboarding, just name it and I’d be down to join you. I also love taking naps at Moffitt. :p Feel free to talk to me about anything, happy to meet you!
