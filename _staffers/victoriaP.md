Hello Everyone! I'm a junior studying CS and this is my third year working with CS10. Currently, I work as an intern at a software company, SAP. I'm also a part of Dan Garcia's research groups, GamesCrafters and CS Education. When I first took the course, I had no programming experience. I fell in love with it and became a BJC and Snap! evangelist. As a non-traditional student coming back to school after a gap-four years, I believe anyone can learn CS, and CS is a field for everyone - no matter your age, skill level, or past performance. If I can impart any advice, it is don't be afraid to fail, and just because you don't know something now, does not mean you won't know it soon!
