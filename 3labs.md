- Name at least two different ways to achieve repetition.
- Show us your random-walk sprite.

- What is the difference between the `for each (item)` loop and the `for (i)` loop we have used in previous labs?


**Lab 4**{: .label .label-lab } [Fractal Recursion](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=berkeley_bjc/recur/recursion-trees-fractals.topic&course=cs10_su21.html&novideo&noreading&noassignment)

- Why is it important that the inputs to a recursive call be smaller than the original inputs to a function?
- Why is it important that the sprite face the same direction at the end of a recursive fractal block as it faced initially?
- What defines a recursive block? Name and explain the two necessary cases that a recursive block must consider?
- Show us your `snowflake` block.


**Lab 5**{: .label .label-lab } [Recursive Reporters](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=berkeley_bjc/recur/recursive-reporters-part1-su21.topic&course=cs10_su21.html&novideo&noreading&noassignment)

- Why do we map the first item of the set in front of a recursive call of `subsets` over the rest of the list?
- (Optional) Explain why the second version of `subsets` only makes 7 calls instead of 64.
- Explain how the `sort` block works, how the `merge` block works, and how they work together.
- Show us your recursive `numbers` block.
- Show us your recursive `ends-e` block.


**Lab 6**{: .label .label-lab } [Welcome to Python!](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=berkeley_bjc/python/besides-blocks-welcome-parsons.topic&course=cs10_su21.html&novideo&noreading&noassignment)

- What is the difference between the `python`, `python file.py`, and `python -i file.py` terminal commands?
- What is the difference between `print` and `return` in Python?
