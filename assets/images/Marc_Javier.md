Hi! I'm a rising sophomore studying CS/DS. This will be my first semester AI-ing for CS10 and I'm super excited to start. This was my first CS course and despite Berkeley being a notoriously hard school (especially in CS), CS10 was very beginner friendly and the staff was beyond patient while I was learning. So don't be intimidated by it! Outside of studying and doing work, I love to collect Pokemon Cards :). I can't wait to help all of you!
